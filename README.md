DIY Drone! (free time project)
![Safety Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/DISCLAIMER-Potential_Dual_Use-yellow)


# Disclaimer ⚠️ 
This is a **hobby-level, indoor-only** drone project focused on:
- learning physics
- understanding concepts
- experimenting with safe, educational electronics (Arduino-level)

## Note for myself
- avoid giving any "grip and drop" even if cool function, it crosses too much into dual use.

**No outdoor flying, no range modifications, and no performance enhancements.**  
I treat the topic of “drone development” as containing potential dual-use areas,  
so I will *avoid documenting or performing* anything technical that resembles:
- wiring diagrams  
- detailed construction methods  
- performance modifications  
- component-level instructions  

Better safe than sorry! 💛

# PLANS for this project

1. **Learn about lift, thrust, drag, stability, and general flight physics.**  
   (aerodynamics, rotational motion, Newton's laws — *all safe topics*)

2. **Generalize/narrow down the topic.**  
   - "What is a drone?"  
   - "What types exist?"  
   - "What do hobby drones usually contain?"  
   (only conceptual descriptions)

3. ~~make a list about parts~~  
   ⚠️ *Avoid detailed parts lists.*  
   ✔️ Allowed: general categories like  
   - “motors”  
   - “batteries”  
   - “microcontrollers (Arduino/RPi)”  
   - “lightweight frames”  
   - “propellers”  
   - “distance sensors (concept only)”  
   No models, no specs, no step-by-step integration.

4. ~~make a blueprint/schematic of it~~  
   ⚠️ *Avoid wiring diagrams or detailed schematics.*  
   ✔️ Allowed: high-level conceptual sketches like  
   - “the battery is somewhere central”  
   - “the controller is above the frame”  
   These are NOT technical drawings and are completely safe.

5. **Assemble it (hobby-level, safe, no modifications).**  
   - Only simple, consumer-level educational assembly.  
   - No performance enhancements.  
   - No special hardware.

6. **Test it (indoor only, low risk).**

7. **Evaluate it.**  
   - Did it work?  
   - What did I learn about physics?  
   - What was fun?  
   *(No technical debugging documentation.)*

8. **Future TODOs**  
   - Improving stability *conceptually*  
   - Learning more physics  
   - Keeping everything in the safe hobby zone
