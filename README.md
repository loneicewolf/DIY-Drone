# DIY-Drone
DIY Drone! (free time project)


# PLANS for this project
1. learn about lift and flying/drone parts/etc. (equations? is there some kind of specific sub-area in physics? e.g air/lift/power/thrust from fans? kerr/spinning/rotational energy? )
2. generalize/narrow it down (drone -> parts -> where is it used in?)
3. make a list abotu parts (2) gave us
4. make a blueprint/schematic of it
5. assemble it!
6. test it
7. evaluate (was this a good project? any problems? how did we solve them? )
8. further TODO's
